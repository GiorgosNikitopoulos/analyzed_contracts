## Integer Underflow Exploit

The integer underflow example works with the <strong> integer_underflow_1.sol </strong> the same way as the overflow exploit. <br>
If we subtract 1 from a value 0, the value will become 2^256-1 since the variable is of type <strong> uint256 </strong>
```
Firstly, make the sellerBalance variable public in order to check the value.
Check that the value is 0.
Subtract by 1, using the sub function and 1 as argument.
The value takes the price: 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
