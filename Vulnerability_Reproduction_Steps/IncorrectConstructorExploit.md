## Incorrect Constructor Exploit

The exploit is based on a vulnerability where the Constructor does not have the correct name. <br>
In the example in <strong> incorrect_constructor.sol </strong> , the wrong constructor attempts to initialise the owner as the msg.sender.
<br>
But instead, the name is IamMissing instead of Missing, and as a public function, anyone can call it if he has the address of the contract.
<br>
We need to have two Ropsten accounts to reproduce the vulnerability.
```
First, deposit some eth by the account that deployed the contract, and assumes he is the owner.
With another account, call the IamMissing function and become owner.
Now, the second account, being the owner, can withdraw the money the first account deposited.
```
